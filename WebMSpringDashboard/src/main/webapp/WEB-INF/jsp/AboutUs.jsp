<h2> About Us</h2>

<p>
 The story started with my dad's accident back in 1988 when I saw my mother running helplessly here and there
She could barely help any help and the days were like a nightmare.
</p>

<p>

Later, as I grew up I witnessed similar situations around me within the extended family, friends, relatives and neighbours.
Now a days,the work life of an individual has become robotic with no time to breathe. Reaching your loved during the critical hours might not always be possible.
</p>

<p>
Our motto is to tackle difficult situations , managing tough times and reach out the needy/patient in shortest possible time. We are completely committed in taking care of your loved one and do all the needful until your arrival.
</p>
<p>
Physical and mental well being is another aspect where we strongly feel that it can boost up one's life. We thus pledge to be available for all kinds of help and support to re-blossom your parents/loved ones life so that every moment becomes joyful and every passing day becomes stronger than the previous one.
